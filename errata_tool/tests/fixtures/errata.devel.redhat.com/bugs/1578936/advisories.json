See the following advisory for the container images for\nthis release:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:2510\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs: \n\n* When running the deploy_cluster.yml playbook during an OpenShift install, the installer would fail with an error. Now, the repo example host inventory file has been updated to include the requirement of openshift_node_group_name for hosts. (BZ#1656475)\n\n* Previously, timezone configuration was not mounted into the control plane static pods, which led to logging timestamps not aligning with all other system logs. The host's timezone configuration is now mounted into the control plane pods. (BZ#1690557)\n\n* If a pod using an egress IP tried to contact an external host that was not responding, the egress IP monitoring code may mistakenly have interpreted that as meaning that the node hosting the egress IP was not responding. Highly available egress IP addresses may have been switched from one node to another spuriously. Now, The monitoring code distinguishes the case of \"egress node not responding\" from \"final destination not responding\". (BZ#1732486)\n\nAll OpenShift Container Platform 3.10 users are advised to upgrade to these\nupdated packages and images.","solution":"Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\n\nFor OpenShift Container Platform 3.10 see the following documentation,\nwhich will be updated shortly for release 3.10.163, for important\ninstructions on how to upgrade your cluster and fully apply this\nasynchronous errata update:\n\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/release_notes/ocp_3_10_release_notes.html\n\nThis update is available via the Red Hat Network.
